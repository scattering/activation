Simple server for running the neutron activation calculator.

This is intended for testing.  It has not been assessed for security and is
not recommended for a public facing server.  The activation calculator
expects a cgi interface, which should be provided by the web infrastructure
(apache, nginx, etc.) that you are using on your production server.

Usage: python server.py [host | host:port]

Default is localhost:8008
